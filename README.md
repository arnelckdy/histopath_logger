4. The output will be compiled in output.csv.

## Files Included
1. HistopathLogger.py and PapsLogger.py are the executable Python scripts for histopathology reports and Pap smears respectively.
2. requirements.txt lists all needed dependencies for executable scripts to run.
3. HistopathLogger.ipynb and PapsLogger.ipynb are the Jupyter note files for histopathology reports and Pap smears respectively.
